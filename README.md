# EDA-on-Diwali-Sales-data

Exploratory data analysis is an important step towards understanding the data, and is done at the start of any machine learning or data science project.
Here, I explored the **"Diwali Sales"** dataset and tried to find out the correlation between amount spent and various characteristics of buyers such as:
* Their gender
* Their age
* Which state they live in
* Their marital status, among others.

### Here is a graph which shows the relation between different **age groups** and the **amount** they spent during Diwali holidays:

### In another instance, the below graph shows the same commparision but for **married** or **un-married** people, further divided by their *gender*:

## Conclusion
In the end, I concluded that:- **Married women from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka working in the fields of IT, Healthcare and Aviation and who belong to age group 26-35 yrs are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics categories.**

## Project Learnings
* Performed data cleaning and manipulation.
* Performed exploratory data analysis using Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn.
* Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, genders and age groups.
* Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet demands.
